yeah it makes sense have the synonyms in the PDF okay now let's look at the thing who is it this filewich Rancher funeral isn't this oh no it's probably this rate okay so it makes sense that that has been said a lot of times and yeah I did say that a lot and so did I say working speaking relay report a lot of times I said but this is speech that was very long as opposed to okay I don't know what this means I again I don't know how to interpret this and that you knew that was recorded so again I think I might because nobody likes to Splat do you like it looks like some sort of stuff addition that we can have are the synonyms and the readability school I think they would be that would be enough to remove the amplitude saw it and then we can do a lot of super cool stuff with this okay so now I will it still going on the 302nd thing I know it's almost 11 did you have to go to 11 I'm willing to stay longer if we can help kind of get a vague sense of what should be the presentation I think it's very stressful usually to have the plan what we'll have another presentation like the day before the night before. We already have it will be a good so that we can kind of keep that in my mind so that the day the presentation actually has to be recorded it's just going to be a matter of oh yeah we already talked about that let's just do that okay so what is this isn't supposed to do is 30 seconds I think that this we have a firm has tenderloin but we can just talk about it a little bit more closer to the presentation or maybe even a depending what you think I think this to me is the same that needs the most kind of thinking and deciding because it's not immediately obvious to me what specific thing we are demoing I did have some I mean we did have some ideas written down for the demo from here yesterday so when idea was I think it would be good to Showcase as many different use cases of Garvis as possible and it how they don't have to be bunched up in a single demos action that can be throughout the six-minute presentation I think there's a particular thing happening life but we can show images that will generate different interesting things throughout and will be very cruel to show a lot of the other things I think the readability score and the synonyms for the more frequently use longer words are going to be such a when we can show different kinds of results so we can show our system running on our own 635 Zoom meetings on our implementation to your presentation onto this these are all different use cases we don't have to include them all in the presentation but we shouldn't do the paper and I think so using our system implementation Studio presentation is is an example of running something on something recorded
