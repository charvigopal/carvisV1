I'm just going to put 300 S just because I don't want to keep running this thing over and over again and I'm just as usually going to keep running this in the background but okay yeah so I think the goal should be since you and I are both very busy the goalie should be to start from an understanding of what exactly needs to be done for the presentation video and everything else can happen after that and so I need to actually write out a lot of stuff in prose format that I was just sending him as random. send Brandon bullet pointy things to add the bus so then there's that for me on Monday I need to send him this and on Thursday during our morning meeting they're going to actually sign off on my thesis and submit it so that's why is there stuff in terms of timeline for this project of their stuff that needs to be done for the term paper but not for the presentation I'm going to do that after the Thursday thesis admission week then Tuesday's the day of the presentation raid yeah yeah so one interesting thing is that I'm just trying to take a look at the sign up spreadsheet to see whether on the sign-up spreadsheet there's any indication of the next studio and the previous two presentations that should encourage them to make something I just want to make sure there's a spreadsheet in which the name and the day is there what is the you like even if it ends up being moved to Thursday and we plan for Tuesday it's not a big deal at all because the main thing is to the video needs to be prepared and if we prepare for Tuesday but they show it on Thursday it's like whatever is so but as to say this should we based our video link to the same sign up spreadsheet as the implementation Studio? mission for testing are we supposed to hold on one second project information for jesting is is that AB dab and it seems like the project information tab has been there for awhile it's been there since at least April 21 April 19th I was also their April 9th and was also there I'm able to see the form responses for last year's project information for testing so what it seems like it seems like what happened is that they imported over the spreadsheet from a previous year and I marched in there was information of previous year projects and then they cleared it on March 10th to this is a Remnant from a previous semester and they had cleared it Sinatra this might just be something from a previous semester on the website which is probably very similar to this project and I am going to go to the place that has the final projects and presentation applications and I'm also going to hold on let me see if the 300 S apparently have not adopt my time is actually really not something's really off of my time going to share my screen and anyone says read my screen I'm going to share okay so this is my screen and on my screen I'm going to open the project for final presentation know I'm going to open for the I'm going to open the meeting notes because there were notes from last time on that document about what needs to be done this one so they were no it's from April 20th trees meeting with should be showing up in just a minute okay see how these were all the things that you can see my screen right time and I think that you were doing a thing where you actually reading everything in the sign of spreadsheet and asking me to put stuff I'm going to skim over that one more time to spend one relatively easy thing on it was that somebody had said that carvis sounds like a name for a car thing which is why they said that but okay okay so before I do anyting let me just check what my terminal is looking like yeah it's not it's I don't know I'm just going to keep this up on the side so that I can see was never recorded by it's done and and I can see when that happens over it one more time I'm also going to go for what's-her-name Sophia's thing one last time because let me pull up her comment I have it because if I feel like it's a tease, that matters more what Sophia said enough Anna projects to read it out again just to be completely sure she said for feedback on the implementation Studio presentation what did she say must be here yeah she said she said the eye contact Jacaranda filler word deduction is really nice honestly it seems like your system is working so smoothly that you can even add an extra mode if you wanted to to train some other public speaking have it no I don't I mean I know she said that but she thinks it's were well because she hasn't seen all the times it's failed the gay striking is not working well and yeah. The demo is just showcasing their worked well so then she said that being said it sounds like a priority wisely is focusing on polishing up where you do have for the final presentation so I agree with her so there's nothing that I have learned from her comments that I didn't already know
