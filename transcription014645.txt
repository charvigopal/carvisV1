oh yeah Ike's I have to speak 499 more seconds than I have currently spoken for which is not particularly nice so what I have your is the ability to do a lot of things and I just need to find a plots in order to proceed and it is true that it's not super duper do we ever see Brazil as an importer so if we do sort and filter on importers do we ever see Brazil in here we do not and if we see the important across ears do we ever see Krissy Lynn here we do not okay so that makes it clear to me the Chatham House cannot be used to that sort of thing and that we just cannot do that we have to use one and four punch Eva we already have a narco they do and try them house but we can certainly actually do stuff to clarify to insure them and be good I do this let me actually make sheep maps for shut them legal override a audio recording right now but I am continuing to I am currently recording something while speaking about Brazil that Indonesia and my thesis so I'll send you that and it's transcript I'll try to keep sending you some okay so. Is be bugging out for that is very useful in general and so we just need to look at wedding no I was just busy pushing something to get herb okay let's try taking this shot them legal stuff and putting it in the panjiva and by end and what I want is to do this to do this and toothpaste it here and it's do another enter to do this to baste it here to do another enter to do this to baste it here and then I want to just do this and paste this here and put a plus sign and paste this in this jupyter notebook hello Asian if you were listening to this demo. a file that I have sent you for the purposes of debugging you probably going to hear me talk drunk about how stressed I have about this Easter think it's going well I am figuring some things out that are very exciting but what is going on 123 I think I copied something a lot of diets oh my god what have I done oh no I just forgot to turn this into markdown otherwise it should be seven things and we can keep running this and keep it going throughout all right so shut the next course is not defined we just need to replace that with panjiva exports tropical roundwood and we need to just replace this file with wengie but Imports tropical roundwood and then we just need to run the whole oil for again with this query to see whether I can get it for the bench Eva and buy n good so reporter country I need to just always Group by the reporter country because that is what I've been doing as convention so I'm glad it failed let's run this thing I do I keep have okay I still have to keep speaking so now what I think is happening is that it's going to and buy an analysis going to be Imports and importers and when we open this up in Excel please don't okay we're going to just close this saving open the same fired with a similar name so that when we open it we are able to filter by reporter country of Brazil and then when I just apply the filter to the reporter country potato Brazil what I see is a lot of values that is cool and when I just do the same thing for Indonesia and open it up in Microsoft Excel what I see is reporter country of Indonesia when I do Indonesia and make that happen and I so I have it for some years not all but and I need to investigate why I don't have it for all the years do I have in my bunch Eva 19 by 19 do I have the thing where I am doing some I need to open Vinci by 19 by 19 in hope and pray 19 by 19 I mean that's completely expected the Brazil's reported Imports it is reporting Imports And the reporter country none in 2009 Okay cool so I particularly care about my 42011 should be empty 2012 should be empty 2013 should be empty and 2015 I don't know what's going to happen it makes sense to have something and 16 17 18 19 20 again for the 399 study for too long that I'm super excited by this analysis week is 30 super duper cool good that is still a high-value actually wow okay so hopefully it is good and a little bit of a problem might be with the manual stop after Brazil and Indonesia which I'm not looking forward to but the good thing is that as soon as I'm done with that I can actually write up the whole section without any kind of interruption although this makes me really angry
