used to interpret something like and how it appears so I'll show you old interesting you did something different trade-weighted you and Dakota Laden really and presentation and should so these their lot of like strong words going on and it makes sense and then a lot of filler words used to I love it I love it yeah this is cool this is so cool right cuz as long as yeah we should try to remove the shoes but and also the did somebody human how did it know to highlight the inhuman if it never showed up here so I'm assuming you have a list of filler words right that you search with just a space on either end every and other words that get detective they get on and highlighted this is from my experience like ta a W-9 when I don't want to do the work for actually doing the lab so I try to look for as many shots as possible to minimize the amount of time I have to spend prepping an expert at looking fish. That's okay yes you do this and let me know if that works and meanwhile I'll be looking at the next transcript to diseases any interesting things and you can push this I mean you can push this as soon as you have it or acid first locally I pulled whatever you had pushed like half an hour ago and I I did that recording that I will run it with the word yacht I think in in either in any of these things if a wood has been said less than once it should be excluded I feel like because there's a lot of fear going on a lot of these words I absolutely love the feel of our detection its weight is it easy to just add like explanatory Jacks in better font to explain what the report is almost to make it like a very nice other contacts but that are like four pages that are like a bunch of interesting quotes and stuff on those pages and I'm pretty sure that it's not difficult to change the font rate
