okay so let's see whether we are able to check out any interesting kind of Trends from the transcript that just got recorded and yeah I am concerned about the fact that the Forint is getting a little bit messed up and some of them I'm pretty sure that I said more keywords than you have recorded here and the word adjacency Matrix is something that I said a lot of times so it is definitely not the case that I it's not working quite right this is a little bit concerning I did say the word adjacent say a visiting times that it never showed up so I said adjacency twice. first showed up which I'm definitely concerned about because other words that I said Nest frequency did show up when they should not have maybe showed up so let me win this to him and send it as a messenger thing real quick I feel really good potential bugs in trance and Report 112 looks a bit weird and overlap E2 is that it was it finally made sense to me everything made so much sense to is I said the word adjacent see multiple times and it was captured multiple times in the transcript but it didn't show up in the keywords maybe you can investigate why if you have time okay so the next thing that I'm going to do is let super interesting that it just does not have data print an issue orders zero that is reported from Indonesia and if we look at 3 2010 and we looking at Indonesia it is just zero-rate it is just okay with this is where looking at the wrong thing with a campin Geva I was attending to look at rothenhaus 2010 it was Indonesia just no reported data 2011 I just feel so see no reported data that's just a lot it seems there's a lot more of a lack of data for Indonesia than there is for Brazil Indonesia we can very easily look at these Trends by just looking at that it was also very easy to look at that but okay so then we are still speaking to them okay so this is cool because I've got the exports sure is interesting because I will not get the Imports where there's no way for any of these to get Indonesia tweeden Porter. Yeah I can't do this analysis for anything else because even though I try because if you look at Chatham houses analysis and if you then look at their open with Microsoft Excel if I look it Imports something across yours I will never be able to find the importance of Indonesia find an importer of Indonesia so this is something that I simply cannot do an analysis off based on the data driving given from Chatham House this is just an inherent limitations and I also want to check out
