as what I was going to say is that I versus you wishes etcetera can be really interesting because there's a principal and I don't know if it's a public speaking principal or a general communication principle that when you're trying to have a discussion about somebody's really relevant to presentations but when you have a discussion with somebody about something that they did that you didn't like you should use I statements more than you statements because you can be interpreted as accusatory to bridge a I'm talking to you and I say I think that you did a really bad job for our mini project versus versus saying I feel like you can work harder in activate that still you word but like I feel that we can work harder for this present as opposed to saying you did a bad job in your sloppy does that make sense so in that case you versus I can help us it is interesting that I said that whoever spoke this use the words you more frequently than I it can be interested it could potentially be a sign of like accusatory speech if somebody says you a lot I think because they're just trying to like make assumptions or something like that I'm not sure but what I do think is that we should remove what I'm saying the reason I'm saying this is that this law gives me no real insights and we should either split it up further or remove it or make it because earlier I and we and you I think you should be so awkward but I think you likes them so we get them so I now don't understand why we get them which is why I'm suggesting we take them out of the we actually probably should completely remove this plot we should only keep the plot for words that are at least six long or words that are actually can keep this that's awesome because it shows it shows that we were speaking about you know you can actually get a lot of insides when you look at I versus you worse is V because I try to be cognizant of using the word we when I'm trying to be more collaborative personally I've noticed when I'm angry or I will say I think that this is not good or if I'm really angry at one of my friends whom I hate I'll be like you did this and I don't like that you did this versus like I think for me the extreme end of hitting somebody for what it is I don't like what you did why did you do this it's a frequency of use versus I'm really upset right now that I need to get out bushes let's fix this together we are in the same boat does that make sense so you're doing collaboration with the team are you using words that are like a confrontational person like you  hypothesis a bunch of times and I'm sure that was a lot more positive so I hope that the sentimental Kate still indicates a lot of fear but also into gets angry or I will talk about confrontation and like I was wrong about being angry with a friend and telling him that I hate him didn't I just say that I don't see anything here audio recorded I think we should wrap up after seeing its transcript because I do need to really work on my thesis now but I think that this was a fine session especially your progress has been fantastic during the session and okay I said you in this case but I just I said you in a non-confrontational way okay we maybe we can talk for a few minutes about the last two points just a couple minutes just so we can start thinking about them one thing for you and I to keep in mind is that for a presentation we will have to edit the system diagrams so we can we also need to do that for the presentation we need to edit this right now can we do 9 p.m. tomorrow I like tonight he will concessions it been pretty productive so I would say like a 2-hour thing tomorrow and a 23-hour thing tomorrow or the day after that and are you okay with what is your availability on Monday
