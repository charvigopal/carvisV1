do a 5-minute recording your the next thing that we gotta include I think that's very important or first of all let's just go to the jupyter notebook 40cl correlation that's super important of a thing to go to and when we go to the TCL notebook and really sorry Ashley yeah when we go there we can actually just go to this yeah I'm the most concerned about my knowledge of the Pearson correlation coefficient definitely State whatever Source I'm using to describe that that's actually the thing that I'm the most concerned about okay so data and by end in the appropriate yeah so we can go see when we reach this introduction we can say that the remaining in the methods section and not a lot of steps that also one cool thing if you go to shut them and buy nuc the we already have this okay so calculate to report exports and imports for each year to this is going to be marked down and I need to make sure that my airports are the thing that are the input source am I connected to my airpods and not connect my Butternut airport it's probably going to be super light whatever happens but it does seem like a national airport now so hopefully the writing would be better so now I want to have something different I want to have export summed across importers Yes actually I did the exact same thing so coolest thing on the planet is that I just get to copy this piece of cool with that I wrote for chef and 19 by 19 where in the end I just did it by such as search food to buy for the purpose of how I added things up I don't particularly remember actually but I'm pretty sure I did it for Faust that I can do it again extra food across importers so in a group and you're so let's check out what this does and then I'd need some ears importers and then I'd need exports and across importers. To CSV analysis / experts and importers. CS
