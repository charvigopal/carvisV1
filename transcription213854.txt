I think it's annoying engendered had to keep going for the whole time that we are working during the session especially when we are also doing work so I'll just have her play for the moments and Diane that we do the planning for so I think this can mostly be a work session but I did want to say some words of planning beforehand so the presentation is on Tuesday morning Ray to know how it fits into the presentation if it's not going to be explicitly demo then it might be okay to not do it until the final paper so maybe I can take more of the user-testing load when you are doing your sister before final project for that weekend something interesting right now don't spend more than like an hour doing it if it is taking super long let me hear is the more involved part of actually writing the command so that they flow from one to the other file so that all of garbage can be operated through like like initially urine Garvis and you're able to run carvis from start to finish using a single command line list of things and asked you which of those things you like to do and then you pick the thing you like to do and then it runs the appropriate file it's okay to have a lot of repeated code a lot of coffee patient files in our Garvis repo that do similar things but I think that based on the choice of the command line this weekend demo for our final project we can run Garvis and the thinking Oscars what would you like to do today and you can select one of the drawers and maybe you can give you the josten some orders who won the easier part of it is making it colorful that's not going to be hard but they're tougher part of it is to make the logic just because I think that we have enough work done on this project we can actually use about this meeting to try to decide what logic what sequence to show Stephen dick is the final presentation you remember the initial corvus system diagram that we should people read beginning that is not exactly the diagram that we're going to show now because we don't quite have that level of functionality with that many remember how we sneakily removed gesture between our Design Studio presentation and our protector your presentation and and how's the logic I feel like so I think it was so  and now I'm moving towards the Starboy we can just give them the results of any video so
