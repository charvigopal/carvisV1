310 we have the ability to actually look at the most recently generated transcript from my thesis in which I just talked about a lot of words that are very are very instrumental to my thesis so that's very interesting and it certainly makes me smile a lot okay so just export is what we need to replace this with and what we need to replace this with okay so we need to run all of this and hopefully everything will be great and the only thing that I would have to do in order to can you read the heat Maps is that PLT is not defined but completely fine because all I have to do is employed numpy itertools along with all of these other things because I know that's more protection correlation so I don't really need this important but now if I run everything I should also be able to see it really quickly when I go to would trade close but I should be able to see the fact that I added generated some heat maps in order to make the not need to make the stuff makes sense and if I have just some experience looking back and forth across everything. I'm doing okay so we ran it again and we do have a beautiful thing for exports which I'm really proud of us and this is still running I'm going to let it keep running and yeah so the thing is that split Imports by ear when we did it recently Matrix Imports equals fish. Offend we can do whatever we did for the output because it seems just fine to me we did current your, a Jason seametrics so I'm going to have that be up here for the agency measures generation for this also and I'm going to have this easier and when I have this easier after that it is my responsibility for the agency Matrix to make a hip-hop and the heat map is going to well enough going to have adjacency Matrix Imports adjacency Matrix Imports and we're just going to run in and after we run it we're going to see some cool stuff happen we're going to see about your kidnaps for imports so I need to change this to import and run again significantly easier than I could have ever imagined it to be with this really exciting on the main thing of pregnancy is that for the export I just need to make heat maps for export this is what's going to be here and what's going to be up there is a cheap knives for imports I'm never going to do that again what is happening and it's just a simple line rate it just says it's knocked out and it says make heatmaps for imports the next thing that we have
