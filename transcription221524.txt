okay I'm just going to push this as solve chunksize that are you become good like really good at solving these problems by the way you really get to go that's awesome so I'm just going to push this as change fix chunksize issue in audio record and then I'm going to have okay sister running that's nice and you also push the code for the video record when I speak really quickly I mean even a human would be confused about stuff if you speak really really the video of Sophia one of the TA is had a nice suggestion about how we could make a person give a certain speech at the very beginning of a user test before they've used carbatrol and at the end and then have an independent person and have an independent person evaluate the quality of the two speeches in a randomized order but the problem is that there's if you record one speech and then you record Another speech regardless of whether you've used cars in between or not you have practice mold because you're doing a second speech So the faster you doing it later automatically makes it better in some ways in the first we do need to finalize the procedure for a user test but that we can do ostrich or presentation but I am the opposite of you I think I said this is the beginning of session but I'm the opposite of you in the sense that on Monday I have to send my finest he's the same without placeholders with all-pros unlike the sloppy joe sauce have been sending them so far and that should pretty much be the end of my thing so I am very top-heavy in your very bottom heavy right so yeah I can compensate for that by taking over more of the user testorf but we should prioritize which of my things need the most attention for the test one thing I was wondering if we who is is if we could actually just land what the six-minute presentation would contain and work backwards from there so that every single bug that represents a feature Demi we're obviously not going to make false claims about car best but we can prioritize the features that will be shown in the demo and the things that will be shown in the presentation so that I can be sure to focus on those I don't think I have more than like six hours during the rest of this weekend to work on this stuff I think so I should really prioritize the time that I do have and also there's yeah we should really do you think it'll be enough to work for like 23 hours tomorrow and Sunday to get this done or how much time do you think we'll be taking I don't think I can stand more than 34 hours on Saturday and Sunday on this when is the presentation going to be recorded is going to be recorded on Sunday or Monday afternoon and if needed the two hours a Monday night although I don't like 10 p.m. on Monday nights for the purposes regarding our presentation the good thing about this presentation is that there is not a lot of maybe we should how's the 300 S going it's still going maybe we should talk about what we intend to talk about in the sixth in the six minutes and then work backwards from there and then if there's extra giant since you said you have extra time now and I said I'm completely confident now maybe if you want to you can do things that don't show up in the presentation but I still nice to have but I think I think we should start the readability
