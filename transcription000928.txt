so sure is what's in front of me I've got two hours and in those two hours I got a pretty big goal and the goal that I have is to actually write the sections for 3.1 + 4.10 3.1 should not be difficult to write because 3.1 just includes the yeah okay that's fine so the result of 3.18 is the table in 4.11 okay this is super cool so what we can have is we can have a mapping between this is good okay I like that I like that a lot because I don't actually need to have those for okay write that makes a lot of sense and I think that it should be doable to quit a lot of things in here so when we have these steps we can have similar steps in our results section where we can have 4.1.1 okay okay this is great this is great so the results and discussion or fantastic I think we're all set in terms of exactly what needs to be written for section for next to that is something that is completely I'm ready to work on it so what is the status of the other this and see okay I think that that's fine right okay okay so okay this systematic data download step is simply talking about our examination of the four data sets that we recorded all the three-digit sets that we downloaded and so we might want to have an additional step for what we did with the global Forest watch data but it might not need to be as thorough as that we might need to just say that we took that sub Saturday donate adjacency matrices and the data cleaning section is that the transformation to adjacency matrices I understand that I understand exactly what goes into the section and then I write this and then okay so this should be very very doable in the next 2 hours and right now this transcript Ray this is ending on page 47 I think that it can end on if I can add three to four pages to my thesis of pure writing actually let me in 45 pages of writing on my thesis by 2 p.m. it's not going to be that I want at least get to 52 ish I think that would be a pretty good thing to get to and let me also run the thesis counter now so should be able to easily get to about I want to get to as close to 80 hours as possible and I think it is very very doable so let's just focus on this the reason I'm a little bit concerned about thinking about visualization and the insights from the other thing which was the deforestation there in the 1919s said that can be a little bit more in Fall so I don't want to actually included all I want to okay it's fantastic I have I have many many tables accompanying every single thing I say and now what we're going to do is if we have and it becomes easier and easier to say something this one is the first time you say something kind of dishonest it becomes easier and easier to say it another time and sometimes you were forced into dishonesty by people who are not nice but I don't think you should you should think about that okay anyway coming back to the topic we have the checklist I think that we should have in front of us the checklist here this is going to be the most beautiful section on the planet once it's done so we had the Faust at reported exports table okay the Faust at reported exports Brazil
