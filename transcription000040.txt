okay yeah I'm definitely really sad about this because I was not expecting this to know everybody there was such a good recording going but I am going to have synonyms be sure and I'm going to send this these are some things we talked about today let me add a thing that says April 29in Genesis the stuff that we added April 29 goes here and then I share this and I copied this and I'll just send this out to him to be very professional about things we can keep this here and said these are. play Ralph meeting notes from today and the next thing we can send is this plot of what was not disturb is dark but we said in the presentation and then these are the notes for the evolving presentations credit so that is something that I think should be enough for sending a shot and I will now use carvis in order to do that and let me just close this after taking a quick look at Piazza to see what the Yeah I think this is been resolved and it makes sense what we said at least 5 users for quantitative death so I can do more user tests and what we can do is that we can I can actually potentially even do a user test with her but it seems like it's going to be difficult to do cuz it's going to require a lot of downloading of stuff on your own and so it's going to be very difficult to do I feel like okay they do anticipate needing to do a lot of testing throughout the weekend for this project okay so then would I can do is I can check out the schedule for presentations and once the stops I'm going to run audio record and video transfer. Bye and after that I'm going to be just looking through what I have to do it looks like my computer is also starting to run out of battery so maybe I can keep working on until my brother that went badly I can probably do it Nathan set 30-minute might turn it cuz I switched the audio recording microphone but it might still be the same as before so that's something that we should certainly look at okay but sure is I can I think I can go for a couple more hours and turns of working on my thesis because I would very much like to have the End by and stuff done before asleep if I don't have Anna sleeping can be a break the garbage stuff was already a nice break and I'm going to have the option to stick to more brakes tomorrow and tomorrow is going to be rough for me because I'm going to have to please spend a solid amount of time on deciding what to buy to my thesis but I don't have more than 8 hours of working time tomorrow which is interesting to note okay so I started to work on 6835 at about 9:20 p.m. and I ended the word for 6835 with right I started 235 at approximately 9:20 p.m. and I ended my work approximately now and then I just want to say that I respect what is going on but I will work on my thesis now so far I have worked on my thesis for 60 hours but I'm going to work on my thesis for about I don't know what like 20 more hours to get to 80 hours which should be pretty nice I think okay so let's just keep this going and then run video transcript drop by on it when it's done it'll be a nice d'Este of corvus as well as the rest of it and then I'll stop running corvus so that I can see what came up here I would prefer it we need to check it out okay so I the coolest thing is that I can actually see very very specific things that show up if it's already the 30th of yeah I think that this is not particular the appropriate in my opinion I think that
