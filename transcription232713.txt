okay so I'm excited about this this can actually help us potentially refine our hypothesis of whether or not these are actually keywords so not all of these are keywords for example I tend to use the word something a lot wow okay so this is completely not this is not our hypothesis this is proving our hypothesis wrong actually because here we used something actually because interesting things system there's they're saying that and that kisses know inside you know what we could we don't have to I have an idea yeah go ahead we tend to use longer for the words like interesting and these are not exactly for the words but their words you want to avoid sometimes long words used pnb words that people who are verbals Tristan to use a lot but sometimes they can actually be keywords so since the system is not capable of we can tell the audience if we try to make the system capable of differentiating between the two for now we just implemented something above the long words plot that said oh here are some of the longer words that are more than five characters that you tend to use most frequently you can look at these words and and their highlighted below you can look these words to see if they are words that are of importance need to keep using all of these words that are just filler words are words that you want to keep replacing and then we can  three synonyms for the word if if they were less than three synonyms according to the synonym API we assumed that the words were more technical jargon words that will keyboard and we only get the synonyms for the words that seemed to have more than three synonyms I can take a look into that so I don't I don't know by tomorrow and like I'm more updated version like next to you can do is what actually I could just give you a more updated what is this song more thing there examples of longer words that are not actually keywords for example accompanied is a word that you pointed out it's not a keyword it all let's just a conjunction or something actually it's a okay cool you're just running it right you're not actually betting code right now we should start by talking about the other two Vivian focus on an impressive demo we talked to some extent about it but I think the impressive demo with the computer and clearer and clearer the more we can like filler wood yeah what other things are for the word
