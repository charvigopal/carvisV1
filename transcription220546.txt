treason maybe you're facing sliding because you want to record me identity of the word jest but when did I suggest we had so that's why it would be cool if I had the transcript with just oh yeah I see that would be so cool in the coolest thing would would have been if there was a Garvis that did interactive data visualization that showed you the let you click on if you have it over particular word it would give you that word color but I think it's fine and general to give the transcript with where you hovered over a word and then it shows you the occurrence of that were the transfer because as I was looking through my report I was looking at the joust and I was like where does it just occurred so and then I said that's why I think your idea of how it is very good because I really want to when I look at these grass I actually want this filler words to be next to words commonly used in speech you know what could happen we could have words commonly used in speech and then we could have the transcript with the commonly used words highlighted then we could when we have filler words we could have the transcript transferred again with the freezer with high that it doesn't make sense oh yeah I was just I was running just running it interesting I say just a lot it seems like so be very cool I mean right now I have to control she highlighted wow okay I really say this word a lot it seems like and yeah I didn't say it the rest of these words very often and then you can see it it actually helps to have them highlighted because the defender words in the most commonly words most commonly use would only make sense and contact straight they only make sense when you look at it in the context of where they were spoken as you were saying cuz some words but not might not be as filler words in the context in which they were spoken so so yeah so is spoken here and here and that is just interesting I can't really tell very much but from the just I could tell a lot one interesting thing about the transcript. Zora don't have ways to denote when a sentence has done being spoken so that's just an interesting thing and yeah we can certainly think about interesting ways to combine the different lot so that we context to the audio and attitude one so yeah we should
