yeah okay so I was just saying that it does seem like it did not record you because a significant portion of this was you joking and it seems to not have recorded you personally I think it's fine because I don't think Garvis is going to equip to analyze things with too many speakers and mine it's kind of clean but where is this is any of this stuff that you said I'm glad that I noticed that you said the word basically several times but it only recorded basically ones and it's good that you're getting closer to so much so and basically okay right the other thing I was going to say is that why these things are running in the background I'm going to look up how to add formatting to the command line how to make a pretty command line how to make a pretty c l i record stem trying to position a picture on the wall and then when they try to place a nail it tells them where to place nail it's really nice having to do all sorts of calculations to the computer uses its own graphical graduations to tell you or did you really yes place near here to help you hang a picture by doing some of the alignments for you I think
