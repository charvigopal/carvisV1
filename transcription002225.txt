300M just really curious to see what the transcript of my speech looks like once I get this transcript I'm going to stop because it can become more distracting than it can be helpful but if we just look at the date added and we should look at today's Jarvis this is what we have this PDF that was generated that I clearly remember but oh that's cool so very interesting that this is what was generated I I certainly am a little bit scared but mostly I'm interested in this and that is very interesting but it's glitching in that way but okay those are some of the keywords that I use in my speech and that's interesting I'm not particularly sure what I did there but I think what would be nice to do is change the audio jack a little bit later but anyway I can keep speaking now so we're going to just clock me this over and whence we copy this over with going to put it in the table and the logs depend on which unit shut them house is doing and socialism has is in the final table I think I'm completely capable of doing this I'm going to stop recording the transcripts after the associate them house this table is associated with these are all answering the same questions I think and then I think that every question I ask needs to be associated with a pictograph and we can work on those in just a moment but would I do need from us and this is continuing to run what I need from us is in order to look at the chef and how stable we need to tell what shut them house meter cube okay meter cube let's just formatted a little bit nicely so that it shows up as how do we format this a little bit nicely so that it shows up as a superscript instead of anything else I want to show so that it shows up as as superscript format text superscript okay superscript and format text superscript Ono format decks superscript okay so the next thing I'm going to do is well this is going to be the table associated with that there's going to be figures and tables associated with every single section of the thesis or they just need to be added in there okay let me wait for this to hit 5 minutes meanwhile once I generate the PDF once I generate this and I copy this to clipboard and I go here I can actually go to the place in the cold where this is specifically I can go to the place in the cold where this is and what I can do is since this is for Brazil I can add something at the very end here and if you go to its corresponding Place good so all you need to do is add something that says centering okay and then we just need to add a caption and a labor so the caption can be the caption and label come after the centering race with caption can be the countries to which Brazil reported exporting laws exporting logs from from 2000 to 2014 Dave from 2000 to 2014 inclusive according to the Chatham house dataset so this is exports Partners Chef them is what this is going to be so this looks pretty nice in general I think and the partners that we can get o yeah she's going to be logs in m q do supposed to be in million M cubed but I made the units the same for the purposes of the comparison so it's trying not to UK and it is China to UK it is okay so the cool thing is that the we can actually check things are competitive so we can check that brassiere protects pudding try not to 98,000 and China will there a different time scale to bacon see the China is relatively above France which is above the United States of America which is above what witches and the Netherlands doesn't show up here United Kingdom it doesn't have a lot reported to the United Kingdom so we can make those kinds of comparisons across the data sets Okay so we will now compare yeah it's not a good comparison I think because you are a little bit confused about how to these things because these things in the table or a little bit different in the table they are different in the sense that they are shown as yeah I can't really do that can I I can't really tell because it's yeah I'm not going to include Chatham house because Chatham house is only including data for exports to Brazil and it's only including data for imports for some other countries does not even really letting me see what I could do with a grouchy check for all the countries I can do reporting a new no country would I can do here is I can say that for my graph of the export summed across of the imports from Sumner trust years if I open this for Chatham House and if I adjust filter by the exporter being Brazil and I applied this filter then open my input will never be perceive that we were saying right
