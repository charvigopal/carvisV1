there is a point which is irrelevant too good to answer so be prepared to put in some time on this question can you think of interesting failures about our audio thing maybe there are things that I can start to think of something like that for example if our system ends up recommending there's one thing that could be an interesting failure what if you say a word such as like a bunch of times but it's not actually a filler word so I put on I put down any ideas that I can think of a lot of our interesting figures could revolve around how the system when it's interpreting something that is said could make mistakes they're the right interesting so maybe there's filler words being detected they're not actually for the words or maybe there is jargon that you cannot replace with something else that needs to be said again and again something you mean something like that rate as an interesting movie that is a good point to think about and this is why we're doing multiple rounds of dusting with everything we speak right so in the next couple of days if there is anything that makes you go haha word that you need to say again and again there doesn't exist to send them for it specific enough or in my species words like adjacency Matrix how are you going to find a synonym for the word adjacency Matrix technical joke that okay here's another idea I like the idea we have but another idea is if you're giving a talk accompanied by slides in which you keep using words like you keep using maybe I noticed that in your presentation if we analyzed our presentation of the implantation Studio I'm pretty sure that we're going to see the word next a lot of times because that was the word you used to indicate to me that I had to go to the next flight within the scope of the project to analyze the slides that a person is presenting along with the words that they're saying so it's possible that they use a lot of words such as this and that and hear words that could be vague and generally would indicate Badness if you were using this not a lot of times while being vague that's generally in like writing consider not good but combined with the multimodal pointer like if you're pointing to a slide and saying this and that that's completely fine next and things like that actually forms a really nice like cohesive thing right because this is all about things that are detected to be actually there's a scene here is not all words that are repeated are bad like I mean you know we can expand upon that and that's a very poorly phrased thing but repetition is not inherently bad if there is some sort of meaning to it and our system in our system I'm just going to write whatever I'm saying because I'm classes they often teach you that you need to repeat things for it to really sinking to the audience's head because we should say something only once the audience won't be able to get it  something like that than words because I think scanning the long words using speech actually gives you a sense of the keywords it gives you a sense of because he's a long word using speech and a lot of the words like here scanning this plot and looking at this actually gives you almost a summary of
