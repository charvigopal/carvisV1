I just keep running audio to go to the background okay let me look at the transcript at the report that just came so that that includes the plot at the beginning for Lodi long words a I like this I like this I do tend to use the word interesting a lot and it makes sense that we use the word filler and that is fine and this is a shorter transcript when I was expecting that I think it's maybe not recording your voice today so that makes sense to me okay yeah she was saying for the user presentation audio amplitude when the speech is very long the timescale access at the time axis gets compressed so much that even if there are bosses you won't be able to see them because they will look very small so the user presentation audio on Bluetooth graph becomes is useful when you speak very long and in general I like the other people and not sure what to make of this what is this plot tell me about how I am is a speaker it maybe tells me that I attended two legs go really up up up up at this point and speak loudly but I wasn't speaking too loudly during this month I'm assuming that what this means for this context is that you were speaking during this point in time because it is likely that you were speaking so more salty than I was but again that doesn't tell me anything and I'm almost wondering if you can we can change this entirely or not show this even if this is plotting the pauses maybe you can just get the balls information processing the data that like here we do have a you did her and diameter so I'm assuming are they what format are they in inside are they in the format of two lists this fraction of the max amplitude for more than 33 seconds considered show just the information about the pauses about or or maybe do you think it's possible to somehow energy of this plot I think it's difficult using haven't tried it and for the sentiment yeah we should definitely add we should definitely add decks before saying that this is the sentiment from your text yeah I can if you want that is also something that I'm interested in working and working on to add like explanatory Jets to make it read like a cohesive report that I'm going to be very interested in but I just don't know how high-priority it is for the demo for our user test because we can actually make a user's go to the thing and talk about their inside so they're getting as the reading the report and whether it's helping them or or something but that's on the new transcript on the new video audio that gets reported okay I am continuing to speak for the purposes of this recording after this ioki it does sound like a good idea to do a crap off the presentation and to just name all the things that I'm supposed to do for the reservation itself to combine these points with presentation to make the presentation person and focus on those parts of the demo that will be used for the final presentation so first with us what the system is supposed to do an impressive demo how it works so we should be drawing new diagrams and how well it works and oh gosh okay so this is really really exhausted we need to spend a lot of time on the presentation seems like which is definitely making me a little bit nervous and not going to lie about this and I'm going to probably call this whole thing presentation nervousness and now I'm going to just finish talking soon hopefully it's Ryan s should be up but we should be doing a whole brainstorming what should be in the presentation I think before we stopped and I think it makes sense for us to rekindle at 8:09 p.m. tomorrow to go over the different things and enjoy little 9 p.m. tomorrow I'm going to be working on the majority meditacao it is done and it's like a day-long exam that I write that involves many many hours of tests and a lot of stuff so that's what's going to happen
