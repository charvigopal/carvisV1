okay yeah okay so one thing that we could consider the cool thing is that if word has been recorded Trice transcribed rice in 9 minutes that I've probably definitely said it even if I said it twice I probably said it but for something like Avenue since it's only been said once we could actually got to off words that have been used only once because words that have been used only once might be incorrect or they might not even one time is not an interesting sequence of anywhere I was saying a lot of words related to speaking to you can clearly tell the domain of this and I guess I was fearful and not sure but it does seem like I use the word just a lot which it would be this is good because my natural question is I have no memory of using just where do I use it right so so that I can run on it and see what it produces should have like an ad for this meeting top of that make sense fire presentation because we're not Hypocrites we're using our own system to try to get inside and that shows a lot so that's why I wrote in the presentation strip thing however you pronounce his name and 6835 Zoom meetings going to push this in just a moment this one will be called organic highlighting the other thing is that it actually did to text some couple of bigger words here so it makes sense but it did detective few bigger words such as recording interesting detection here and in the final PDF we should definitely put Dexter around I'm having a report that's like that so we can say we can actually read like a almost like it's a report from a teaching assistant or something except it's going to be very open and it's going to be like those tears in classes who asked super open-ended Socratic questions like what do you make of this PDF you know which words do you use a lot but do you want to use do you want to keep using these words do any of these words less just like that okay so let's maybe work on the highlighting now also wait I asked several times now but the readability score stuff is definitely open-source rate good good good cuckoo okay the next thing I wanted to say you did anyway ICC you just have individual PDFs that your stitching together right
