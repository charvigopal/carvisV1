I'm just going to put 300 S just because I don't want to keep running this thing over and over again and I'm just as usually going to keep running this in the background but okay yeah so I think the goal should be since you and I are both very busy the goalie should be to start from an understanding of what exactly needs to be done for the presentation video and everything else can happen after that and so I need to actually write out a lot of stuff in prose format that I was just sending him as random. send Brandon bullet pointy things to add the bus so then there's that for me on Monday I need to send him this and on Thursday during our morning meeting they're going to actually sign off on my thesis and submit it so that's why is there stuff in terms of timeline for this project of their stuff that needs to be done for the term paper but not for the presentation I'm going to do that after the Thursday thesis admission week then Tuesday's the day of the presentation raid
