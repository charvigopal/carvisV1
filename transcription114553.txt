okay good morning to all of you today we are just convene this meeting to kind of disgust what should be the food items that we kind of provide for the next branch that might happen in the middle of next month so I stood is brunch we got a good feedback that the diversity in food was great and good people. Happy with the quality of the foot so we can either continue to maintain the same when you or if you guys want to try something new or provide a different menu next Francis also fine outside so that they can set so I know the chairs and tables are there maybe we could just arrange them in some way to put more space for them to eat even the main lobby area has some places to eat so we can think of using those areas as well to be good then I didn't most people are bringing that utensil so I don't think we need to we can keep continuing that message and I know I think people know
