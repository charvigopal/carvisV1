I think that since the limitations are very very specific to okay yeah these are just words today said a lot of times this is just a bug that we have okay iced ink that it makes sense for us to do this a lot of times let me just let me just go back okay okay okay 1997 to 2014 okay so the coolest thing ever just happened when I was looking at something oh yeah I just had a really cool realization that I don't think discussion should be a section here I think the discussion should be a section inside chapter 5 which is already pretty short so this should probably be discussion and conclusion so we should probably have limitations of this analysis and then we can have a subsection named so I don't know whether it makes sense to have I was thinking of having results and discussion together but I think it makes a lot more sense to have the discussion be a separate section I can see what the csis for Caitlin or did but I can go to dspace PCS it's called relevant CiCi's I think and if I go to Kaitlyn Mahar ceases on Squeezebox what I will see is that if I look at the table of contents she has she has a whole discussion section but then she has limitations and future work and conclusion to the super interesting so what we can have is I'm not entirely sure how to do this but we can have discussion and conclusion maybe we can have continued ocean here and we can have locations of this analysis over here and then in that section we can also have a subsection called oh yeah so that others unspecified area and the other thing is unspecified area is one in the other thing is unspecified area and others adjustment we're not exactly School based on the data that was given to us how this adjustment was calculated but it should not have affected most by Nazis because we didn't do it it okay so then we have limitations of this analysis we can just have limitations and then we can have limitations of our methods limitations than this can be future work and what about the whole thing actually I do think that it makes sense to have the computer on the lookout for where to put this I think that I'm a little confused about the fact that we have subsection subsection subsection yeah that's why it's becoming like this I think oh I see what's happening this is a sub subsection it should be a section actually section yeah yeah I think it's fine to have discussion and confusion be its own section but I'm not entirely sure about how to do that and so yeah Okay cool so we do have the shot them how's Brazil reported exports thing and so we can okay cool I still have to keep talking which is completely fine by me I think that if you put the dataset if you look at the
